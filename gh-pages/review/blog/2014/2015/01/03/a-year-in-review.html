    <p>As I sat in front of my computer in my home in Indianapolis I refreshed the website every hour. Then I would get on facebook to see if there was any talk about the game. Lastly I’d jump on my iPhone to see the high scores rising for Bowl Bouncer. Only three days earlier, December 31, 2013, did we release our game to the world. Over six months in the making it was finally available to the public.</p>

<p>As I refreshed iTunes Match, I saw we had broken the 200 download mark. I let that sink in, 200 people in the world who have played our app. <strong>Oh how I thought that was so impressive.</strong> But more than anything I was proud; proud of the fact that I had done something and everyone could see it.</p>

<p>One year ago I started a journey to places I would never think possible.</p>
